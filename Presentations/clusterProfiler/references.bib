  abstract = {The minimal model was proposed over 25 years ago. Despite (or because of) its simplicity it continues to be used today – both as a clinical tool and an approach to understanding the composite effects of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity on glucose tolerance and risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The original assumptions of the model have led to an understanding of the kinetics of insulin in vivo, as well as the relative importance of β-cell compensatory failure in the pathogenesis of diabetes. The disposition index (DI), a parameter emerging from the model, represents the ability of the pancreatic islets to compensate for insulin resistance. There is evidence that a locus on chromosome 11 codes for the DI, which has a significant heritability and can predict type 2 diabetes better than any known genetic locus. Even today, the model continues to be a subject of scientific discovery and discourse.},

  abstract = {Glucose tolerance depends on a complex interaction among insulin secretion from the β-cells, clearance of the hormone, and the actions of insulin to accelerate glucose disappearance and inhibit endogenous glucose production. An additional factor, less well recognized, is the ability of glucose per se, independent of changes in insulin, to increase glucose uptake and suppress endogenous output (glucose effectiveness). These factors can be measured in the intact organism with physiologically based minimal models of glucose utilization and insulin kinetics. With the glucose minimal model, insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) are measured by computer analysis of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. The test involves intravenous injection of glucose followed by tolbutamide or insulin and frequent blood sampling. SI varied from a high of 7.6 × 10−4 min−1 · μU−1 · ml−1 in young Whites to 2.3 × 10−4 min−1 · μU−1 · ml−1 in obese nondiabetic subjects; in all of the nondiabetic subjects, SG was normal. In subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), not only was SI reduced 90\% below normal (0.61 ± 0.16 × 10−4 min−1 · μU−1 · ml−1), but in this group alone, SG was reduced (from 0.026 ± 0.008 to 0.014 ± 0.002 min−1); thus, defects in SI and SG are synergistic in causing glucose intolerance in NIDDM. One assumption of the minimal model is that the time delay in insulin action on glucose utilization in vivo is due to sluggish insulin transport across the capillary endothelium. This was tested by comparing insulin concentrations in plasma with those in lymph (representing interstitial fluid) during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps. Lymph insulin was lower than plasma insulin at basal (12 vs. 18 μU/ml) and at steady state, indicating significant loss of insulin from the interstitial space, presumably due to cellular uptake of the insulin-receptor complex. Additionally, during clamps, lymph insulin changed more slowly than plasma insulin, but the rate of glucose utilization followed a time course identical with that of lymph (r = .96) rather than plasma (r = .71). Thus, lymph insulin, which may be reflective of interstitial fluid, is the signal to which insulin-sensitive tissues are responding. These studies support the concept that, at physiological insulin levels, the time for insulin to cross the capillary endothelium is the process that determines the rate of insulin action in vivo. In separate experiments, a similar intimate relationship was found between lymph insulin and glucose utilization estimated from the minimal model, supporting the accuracy of the minimal model as a mathematical representation of insulin action in vivo. Additional factors in glucose tolerance are insulin secretion and clearance. We proposed a model of insulin/C-peptide kinetics, derived from the original conception of Eaton and Polonsky, in which determination of C-peptide kinetics in each individual is unnecessary if insulin and C-peptide kinetics are modeled simultaneously. Prehepatic insulin secretion after glucose injection was calculated in healthy women; total insulin secretion was 22.2 nmol; first-phase insulin averaged 38\% of total, but there was wide variation among healthy subjects. The ability to determine insulin secretion, insulin action, and glucose effectiveness from modeling allowed us to investigate their interaction. We propose that in healthy individuals, there is a balance between secretion and insulin action such that insulin secretion × insulin sensitivity = constant. Thus, with insulin resistance, it is proposed that a normal β-cell will increase its sensitivity to glucose appropriately, staving off impaired glucose tolerance. This concept is supported by data in healthy pregnant women, in whom the reciprocal relationship is shown to exist and impaired glucose tolerance is not observed despite substantial insulin resistance (S, reduced to 1.8 × 10−4 min−1 · μU−1 · ml−1). In subjects at risk for diabetes, e.g., HLA-identical siblings of insulin-dependent diabetic subjects and Pima Indians, insulin sensitivity × secretion \&lt; normal constant value. Additionally, Pima Indians with the lowest sensitivity/secretion product appear to be at highest risk for developing NIDDM. Finally, with simulation of the models, we examined the relative importance of individual and compound defects of SI, SG, and insulin secretion to glucose intolerance. Although no individual defect (≤80\%) of these factors causes diabetic glucose tolerance (KG \&lt; 1), compound defects are remarkably synergistic, with a combined SI/SG defect being the most severe (KG = 0.60), and an SG defect being a requisite component for diabetic glucose tolerance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               In cystic fibrosis (CF), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is thought to underestimate glycemia. However, few studies have directly assessed the relationship between HbA1c and average glucose in CF. We determined the relationships among glycemic markers—HbA1c, fructosamine (FA), glycated albumin (\%GA), and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG)—and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in CF, hypothesizing that alternate markers would better predict average sensor glucose (ASG) than HbA1c.                                         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               CF participants and a group of healthy control subjects (HCs), ages 6–25 years, wore CGM for up to 7 days. Pearson correlations assessed the relationships between CGM variables and HbA1c, FA, \%GA, and 1,5-AG. The regression line between HbA1c and ASG was compared in CF versus HC. Linear regressions determined whether alternate markers predicted ASG after adjustment for HbA1c.                                         RESULTS               CF (n = 93) and HC (n = 29) groups wore CGM for 5.2 ± 1 days. CF participants were 14 ± 3 years of age and 47\% were male, with a BMI z score −0.1 ± 0.8 and no different from HCs in age, sex, or BMI. Mean HbA1c in CF was 5.7 ± 0.8\% (39 ± 9 mmol/mol) vs. HC 5.1 ± 0.2\% (32 ± 2 mmol/mol) (P \&lt; 0.0001). All glycemic markers correlated with ASG (P ≤ 0.01): HbA1c (r = 0.86), FA (r = 0.69), \%GA (r = 0.83), and 1,5-AG (r = −0.26). The regression line between ASG and HbA1c did not differ in CF versus HC (P = 0.44). After adjustment for HbA1c, \%GA continued to predict ASG (P = 0.0009) in CF.                                         CONCLUSIONS               HbA1c does not underestimate ASG in CF as previously assumed. No alternate glycemic marker correlated more strongly with ASG than HbA1c. \%GA shows strong correlation with ASG and added to the prediction of ASG beyond HbA1c. However, we are not advocating use of HbA1c for diabetes screening in CF based on these results. Further study will determine whether glycemic measures other than ASG differ among different types of diabetes for a given HbA1c.},

Relationships between these CGM abnormalities and oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) in PwCF have not been fully characterized.                                         Objective               This work aimed to determine the relationship between CGM and common OGTT-derived estimates of β-cell function, including C-peptide index and oral disposition index (oDI) and to explore whether CGM can be used to screen for OGTT-defined prediabetes and cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (CFRD).                                         Methods               PwCF not on insulin and healthy controls aged 6 to 25 years were enrolled in a prospective study collecting OGTT and CGM. A subset underwent frequently sampled OGTTs (fsOGTT) with 7-point glucose, insulin, and C-peptide measurements. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test the association between select CGM and fsOGTT measures. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was applied to CGM variables to determine the cutoff optimizing sensitivity and specificity for detecting prediabetes and CFRD.                                         Results               A total of 120 participants (controls\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}35, CF\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}85), including 69 with fsOGTTs, were included. CGM coefficient of variation correlated inversely with C-peptide index (Cpeptide30-Cpeptide0/Glucose30-Glucose0) (r\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}–0.45, P\hspace{0.25em}\&lt;\hspace{0.25em}.001) and oDIcpeptide (C-peptide index)(1/cpep0) (r\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}–0.48, P\hspace{0.25em}\&lt;\hspace{0.25em}.0001). In PwCF, CGM variables had ROC\hspace{0.25em}–\hspace{0.25em}areas under the curve ranging from 0.43 to 0.57 for prediabetes and 0.47 to 0.6 for CFRD.                                         Conclusion               Greater glycemic variability on CGM correlated with reduced β-cell function.

As classical survival analysis and linear mixed models form the two main components of the JM framework, we will also briefly revisit these techniques.},

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

Other risk factors associated with CFRD are female sex, pancreatic insufficiency, liver disease, need for gastrostomy tube feedings, history of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and poor pulmonary function. CFRD is related to worse clinical outcomes and increased mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment have been shown to improve clinical outcomes. Screening for CFRD is recommended with an annual oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) starting at age 10~years. Diagnosis of CFRD is made by standard American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria during baseline health. CFRD can also be diagnosed in individuals with CF during acute illness, while on enteral feeds, and after transplant. In this review we will discuss the epidemiology of CFRD and provide an overview of the advantages and pitfalls of current screening and diagnostic tests for CFRD.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Population isolates such as those in Finland benefit genetic research because deleterious alleles are often concentrated on a small number of low-frequency variants (0.1\%\,≤\,minor allele frequency\,{$<$}\,5\%). These variants survived the founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored               1,2               . FinnGen aims to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63\,years) and the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS),               P               \,{$<$}\,2.6\,×\,10               –11               ) at 2,496 (771 PWS) independent loci with 807 (247 PWS) end points. Among these, fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of {$<$}5\% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants.},

We compared kidney structural lesions in youth- and adult-onset T2D to determine if youth onset was associated with greater early tissue injury.                                         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               Quantitative microscopy was performed on kidney tissue obtained from research kidney biopsies in 161 Pima Indians (117 women, 44 men) with T2D. Onset of T2D was established by serial oral glucose tolerance testing, and participants were stratified as youth onset (age \&lt;25 years) or adult onset (age ≥25 years). Associations between clinical and morphometric parameters and age at onset were tested using linear models.                                         RESULTS               At biopsy, the 52 participants with youth-onset T2D were younger than the 109 with adult-onset T2D (39.1 ± 9.9 vs. 51.4 ± 10.2 years; P \&lt; 0.0001), but their diabetes duration was similar (19.3 ± 8.1 vs. 17.0 ± 7.8 years; P = 0.09). Median urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was higher in the youth-onset group (58 [25th–75th percentile 17–470] vs. 27 [13–73] mg/g; P = 0.02). Youth-onset participants had greater glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width (552 ± 128 vs. 490 ± 114 nm; P = 0.002) and mesangial fractional volume (0.31 ± 0.10 vs. 0.27 ± 0.08; P = 0.001) than adult-onset participants. Glomerular sclerosis percentage, glomerular volume, mesangial fractional volume, and GBM width were also inversely associated with age at diabetes onset as a continuous variable.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Younger age at T2D onset strongly associates with more severe kidney structural lesions. Studies are underway to elucidate the pathways underlying these associations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes (CFRD) diagnosis and management have considerably changed since diabetes was first shown to be associated with a poor prognosis in subjects with CF. Current trends in CFRD prevalence, incidence, and mortality were determined from a comprehensive clinical database.                                         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               Data were reviewed from 872 CF patients followed at the University of Minnesota during three consecutive intervals: 1992–1997, 1998–2002, and 2003–2008.                                         RESULTS               CFRD is currently present in 2\% of children, 19\% of adolescents, and 40–50\% of adults. Incidence and prevalence are higher in female subjects aged 30–39 years; otherwise, there are no sex differences. In younger individuals, CFRD without fasting hyperglycemia predominates, but fasting hyperglycemia prevalence rises with age. CFRD mortality has significantly decreased over time. From 1992–1997 to 2003–2008, mortality rate in female subjects dropped by \&gt;50\% from 6.9 to 3.2 deaths per 100 patient-years and in male subjects from 6.5 to 3.8 deaths per 100 patient-years. There is no longer a sex difference in mortality. Diabetes was previously diagnosed as a perimorbid event in nearly 20\% of patients, but of 61 patients diagnosed with diabetes during 2003–2008, only 2 died. Lung function but not nutritional status is still worse in CF patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes. Nutritional status and pulmonary status are similar between patients without fasting hyperglycemia and those with fasting hyperglycemia.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Previously noted sex differences in mortality have disappeared, and the gap in mortality between CF patients with and without diabetes has considerably narrowed. We believe that early diagnosis and aggressive treatment have played a major role in improving survival in these patients.},

  abstract = {The minimal model is widely used to evaluate insulin action on glucose disappearance from frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGT). The common protocols are a regular (rFSIGT, single injection of 0.3 g/kg of glucose) and an insulin-modified test (mFSIGT, with an additional insulin administration at 20 min). This study compared the insulin sensitivity index (S               I               ) and glucose effectiveness (S               G               ) obtained in the same individual (16 normal subjects) with the two tests. S               I               was 7.11 ± 0.80 10               −4               ⋅ min               −1               ⋅ μU               −1               ⋅ ml in rFSIGT and 6.96 ± 0.83 in mFSIGT ( P = 0.656), regression r = 0.92, P {$<$} 0.0001; S               G               was 0.0260 ± 0.0028 min               −1               and 0.0357 ± 0.0052, respectively, statistically different ( P = 0.013) but still with a good regression ( r = 0.66, P = 0.0051). S               G               and insulin amount during the early period correlated ( r = 0.6, P = 0.015 in rFSIGT and r = 0.76, P = 0.0006 in mFSIGT). In summary, both FSIGTs with minimal model analysis provide the same S               I               , which is a very robust index. S               G               was different by 28\% due probably to the relationship between S               G               and the amount of circulating insulin. In studies comparing groups, the simpler rFSIGT can still be used with the advantage of accounting for endogenous insulin, thus offering the possibility of direct inferences on the β-cell activity.},

Methods that can integrate across multiple high-dimensional data types while accounting for differential patterns are critical for uncovering novel associations and underlying relevant subgroups.                                         Results               We propose an integrative model to estimate latent unknown clusters (LUCID) aiming to both distinguish unique genomic, exposure and informative biomarkers/omic effects while jointly estimating subgroups relevant to the outcome of interest. Simulation studies indicate that we can obtain consistent estimates reflective of the true simulated values, accurately estimate subgroups and recapitulate subgroup-specific effects. We also demonstrate the use of the integrated model for future prediction of risk subgroups and phenotypes. We apply this approach to two real data applications to highlight the integration of genomic, exposure and metabolomic data.

  abstract = {"Preface Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data have become a valuable tool in the analysis of follow-up data. These models are applicable mainly in two settings: First, when focus is in the survival outcome and we wish to account for the effect of an endogenous time-dependent covariate measured with error, and second, when focus is in the longitudinal outcome and we wish to correct for nonrandom dropout. Due to their capability to provide valid inferences in settings where simpler statistical tools fail to do so, and their wide range of applications, the last 25 years have seen many advances in the joint modeling field. Even though interest and developments in joint models have been widespread, information about them has been equally scattered in articles, presenting recent advances in the field, and in book chapters in a few texts dedicated either to longitudinal or survival data analysis. However, no single monograph or text dedicated to this type of models seems to be available. The purpose in writing this book, therefore, is to provide an overview of the theory and application of joint models for longitudinal and survival data. In the literature two main frameworks have been proposed, namely the random effects joint model that uses latent variables to capture the associations between the two outcomes (Tsiatis and Davidian, 2004), and the marginal structural joint models based on G estimators (Robins et al., 1999, 2000). In this book we focus in the former. Both subfields of joint modeling, i.e., handling of endogenous time-varying covariates and nonrandom dropout, are equally covered and presented in real datasets"--},

  abstract = {Environmental factors including viruses, diet, and the metabolome have been linked with the appearance of islet autoimmunity (IA) that precedes development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). We measured global DNA methylation (DNAm) and untargeted metabolomics prior to IA and at the time of seroconversion to IA in 92 IA cases and 91 controls from the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY). Causal mediation models were used to identify seven DNAm probe-metabolite pairs in which the metabolite measured at IA mediated the protective effect of the DNAm probe measured prior to IA against IA risk. These pairs included five DNAm probes mediated by histidine (a metabolite known to affect T1D risk), one probe (cg01604946) mediated by phostidyl choline p-32:0 or o-32:1, and one probe (cg00390143) mediated by sphingomyelin d34:2. The top 100 DNAm probes were over-represented in six reactome pathways at the FDR {$<$}0.1 level (q = 0.071), including transport of small molecules and inositol phosphate metabolism. While the causal pathways in our mediation models require further investigation to better understand the biological mechanisms, we identified seven methylation sites that may improve our understanding of epigenetic protection against T1D as mediated by the metabolome.},

  abstract = {We assessed associations between infant diet (e.g., breastfeeding and introduction to solid foods) and DNA methylation in infancy and childhood. We measured DNA methylation in peripheral blood collected in infancy (9–15 months of age) in 243 children; and in a subset of 50 children, we also measured methylation in childhood (6–9 years of age) to examine persistence, and at birth (in cord blood) to examine temporality. We performed multivariable linear regression of infant diet on the outcome of methylation using epigenome-wide and candidate site approaches. We identified six novel CpG sites associated with breastfeeding duration using an EWAS approach. One differentially methylated site presented directionally consistent associations with breastfeeding (cg00574958, CPT1A) in infancy and childhood but not at birth. Two differentially methylated sites in infancy (cg19693031, TXNIP; cg23307264, KHSRP) were associated with breastfeeding and were not present at birth; however, these associations did not persist into childhood. Associations between infant diet and methylation in infancy at three sites (cg22369607, AP001525.1; cg2409200, TBCD; cg27173510, PGBD5) were also present at birth, suggesting the influence of exposures other than infant diet. Infant diet exposures are associated with persistent methylation differences in CPT1A, which may be one mechanism behind infant diet’s long-term health effects.},

This study evaluated mental health follow-up rates in youth and young adults with type 1 diabetes who screened positive for depressive symptoms or suicidal ideation and identified differences between those who obtained follow-up mental health care and those who did not. Specifically, males were less likely to obtain follow-up, and those who had mental health follow-up had decreasing A1C over the following year. These findings suggest increased assistance and monitoring are needed to ensure follow-up mental health care is obtained.},
