Time-to-death:
-Cox PH multivariable models
-Special features: 
--log(2) transformation of predictors due to skewness 
--interactions by continuous*binary predictors
-RMD file: 03_overall survival

Time-to-treatment related mortality (TRM) with other death (primary/unrelated) as a competing risk
-Competing risks multivariable regressoin
-cmprsk package in R (crr function) - "proportional subdistribution hazards' from Fine and Gray
