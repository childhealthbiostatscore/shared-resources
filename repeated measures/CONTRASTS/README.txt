Repeated measures - longitudinal data on mice.
Fit GLMM for various experiments, plotted estimated least square means over time

-- r packages: nlme, afex, lsmeans
-- reshape wide to long
-- contrast statements to test for specific comparisons 
(i.e. group differences at pre-specified time points, and
group differences in overall change)
-- plots of individual mice overlaid with predicted mean from model
